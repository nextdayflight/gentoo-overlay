This is my Gentoo Portage overlay. It contains general stuff, self-bumps, ebuilds pulled from b.g.o, etc.

media-libs/libdvdread-4.1.4_p1217 :
media-libs/libnav-4.1.4_p1217 :
  These are slightly newer revs than those in Gentoo Portage.
  Apart from the usual bug fixes, the newer rev of libdvdread
  restores a DVDFileStat method which is needed
  by recent versions of dvdbackup
  (This was in the 0.9.7 series but not in the MPlayer
  4.1.3_p1168 version that is marked stable in Gentoo Portage)

  The ebuilds themeselves are simple copies of the Gentoo 4.1.3_p1168 versions,
  with a slight patch to make sure the libraries are versioned at 4.1.4 to
  match the ChangeLog.

dev-cpp/sparsehash-1.9 :
  Copied from Gentoo dev-libs/sparsehash-1.5.2.ebuild.
  Converted hopefully successfully to EAPI=2
  Added a tiny patch so that tests compile with clang.
