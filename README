This is my Gentoo Portage overlay. It contains general stuff, self-bumps, ebuilds pulled from b.g.o, etc.

app-misc/ec2-api-tools-bin :
    Amazon EC2 CLI tools.
    (Latest version, based on ec2-api-tools-1.6.7.2.ebuild from gentoo-x86
    renamed to 'ec2-api-tools-bin' to reflect it still uses bundled JARs.
    Has fixes to work in gentoo-prefix)

dev-libs/avro-c :
    Apache Avro - C client library

dev-python/avro :
    Apache Avro - Python client library
