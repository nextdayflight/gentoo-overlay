This is my Gentoo Portage overlay. It contains general stuff, self-bumps, ebuilds pulled from b.g.o, etc.

media-libs/libdvdread-4.1.3_p1199 :
media-libs/libnav-4.1.3_p1199 :
  These are slightly newer revs than those in Gentoo Portage.
  Apart from the usual bug fixes, the newer rev of libdvdread
  restores a DVDFileStat method which is needed
  by recent versions of dvdbackup
  (This was in the 0.9.7 series but not in the MPlayer
  4.1.3_p1168 version that is marked stable in Gentoo Portage)

  The ebuilds themeselves are simple copies of the Gentoo 4.1.3_p1168 versions.


media-video/dvdauthor-0.6.18 :
  Based on the ebuild from http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi?id=308899 with some
  slight changes:
  - switched SRC_URI to the (now) more "official" Sourceforge package.
    (doesn't required rpath patching, etc.)
  - Added the graphicsmagick patch from Fedora
